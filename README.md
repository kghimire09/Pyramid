# Pyramid
Your stack of blocks should fit "exactly" into a centered rectangle that is 80% of the window's width and height. Use a constant to indicates the number of rows to be placed in the rectangle. Unlike the book's version, the width and height of each brick are directly related to the current size of the window. You may start at either the top or bottom of the pyramid â€“ it can be built in either direction. Make the background white, the background centered rectangle blue and the bricks orange with red outlines. Note that the pyramid should resize itself as the windows is resized i.e. the number of rows will stay fixed, but the block will change size. See the examples Gaps and NoGaps for an example of how to use Swing's Graphics2D class to avoid gaps in the shapes you are drawing.
